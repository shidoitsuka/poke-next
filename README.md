### Why Next.js
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is easy to fast, easy to setup, and basically react.js at the very end. I don't need to setup my router, styles, public folder, and webpack stuffs in order to start developing.
Great DX makes everything fast.

### Why Axios
[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios/) killing feature for me is its instance. From the very first time I'm being a developer, I use axios as my fetch framework.

### Why Vercel
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is completely free and easy to use. I prefer not to deploy it manually to my VPS since it will take times. Also another reason why I use next.js is because it's amazingly easy to use it along with vercel.
